Verification framework for spacecraft control programs targeting the Redfin instruction-set architecture for space satellites subsystems.

The framework is implemented in the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) functional programming language and employs a number of [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) language extensions to employ the type system for specification of instruction semantics.

## Documentation

Take a look at the project [overview](./docs/overview.md).

## Web IDE

The verification framework can be used directly, but for better interaction we also provide a web-browser graphical [interface](https://github.com/geo2a/redfin-ide).
