Work In Progress.

A model of a simplistic RISC instruction set with polymorphic
semantics implemented in terms of fine-grained stateful computations.

Available interpretations of programs:

* State monad and IO based simulators
* Basic symbolic execution (no merging)
* Static data dependency graphs
